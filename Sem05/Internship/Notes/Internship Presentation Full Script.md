# Introduction
Hello everyone! My name is Tomas Ondrejka, and I'd like to share with you my experience as an intern at Qualcomm in Salzburg, Austria, which took place in the second half of 2022. In this video, I'll be giving you a sneak peek into the company, project, and city I worked in, as well as some tips that helped me secure the internship. Let's dive right in!

# Wikitude
The company I worked for is Qualcomm, but the team and office was a part of company called Wikitude, which was acquired by Qualcomm last year. The Wikitude as company was founded in 2008 and is based in Salzburg, Austria. It was a startup that specialized in creating products for augmented reality, including the Wikitude SDK, that is a development framework utilizing image recognition, tracking, and geolocation technologies. The Wikitude SDK is the company's core product, which is available for Android, iOS, Windows, and smart eyewear devices. It includes image recognition, tracking, 3D model rendering, video overlay, and location-based AR. In addition to that, the company had expertise in computer vision, object recognition based on photos, space tracking, and positioning objects in the spaces

# Qualcomm
Moving on to the company where I had my internship, Qualcomm. 
Qualcomm is a multinational technology company that designs and develops semiconductors, software, and services for wireless technology. It is most well-known for its Snapdragon system-on-chip (SoC) products, which power many smartphones and other mobile devices like AR and VRs. It is headquartered in San Diego, California and has operations and customers all over the world. AR is one of the many sectors in which Qualcomm invests in innovation.
Qualcomm has leveraged the technologies created by Wikitude and other acquisitions for a new project called Snapdragon Spaces.

# Snapdragon Spaces
Snapdragon Spaces is project that was the main focus in the office. It is an open XR platform created by Qualcomm for developing AR software using mobile hardware technologies. It provides basic AR features, enabling organizations to quickly create AR apps without developing the technology themselves. Partners in this project include Epic Games, Lenovo, and Oppo. Key features of Snapdragon Spaces include locational tracking, image recognition, and object detection. 

# My team
During my internship, I had the opportunity to work with the Cloud team, which specializes in using AWS as a Cloud Provider. The team was smaller in size and we always communicated in English. Working with the team was a great experience, and we also enjoyed some after-work activities like going out for drinks, whiskey tastings, laser tag, and ice-skating.
The team had a flexible hybrid model that allowed us to work both remotely and on-site. We also practiced pair coding, which allowed us to work collaboratively on code, and we conducted regular code reviews to ensure the quality of our work.

# Methodology
The methodology used in my team was SCRUM. We managed our tasks and progress using Jira, that is a popular project management tool. Our work was organized into biweekly sprints, and we began each day with stand-up meetings where we shared updates on our progress and what we planned to work on next. At the end of each sprint, we had a sprint review meeting with the team and product owners, where we presented our completed work from the previous two weeks. 

# Responsibilities
During my internship at Qualcomm, I had several responsibilities, including developing features on the Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform. I created a library of reusable CDK components to accelerate infrastructure as code (IaC) development, designed and implemented a Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS, and migrated Wikitude.com services to modern and scalable infrastructure. Additionally, I patched and upgraded Ubuntu instances, scripted in Python and Bash, and created CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins for infrastructure and application deployments. These responsibilities gave me valuable experience in cloud technologies and infrastructure as code, and allowed me to make meaningful contributions to the team's projects.

# Improvement
During my internship at Qualcomm, I had the opportunity to improve my cloud and DevOps skills, such as AWS, Terraform, AWS CDK, Linux, Jenkins CI/CD, and Kubernetes. I also improved my coding skills by working with TypeScript and Node.js. Additionally, I enhanced my presentation skills through various presentations on technologies such as Kubernetes, CI/CD, and project generators. I also learned more about the SCRUM methodology, I have improved my task estimation in complexity and time, and learned how to work with Jira. During the internship I have also prepared for and took the Terraform Associate Exam, that allowed me to gain deeper knowledge of Terraform and it's different use-cases. The company and managers had a strong emphasis on supporting employee growth and development, so they were happy for me to take the exam.

# Salzburg
The office I have worked in was located in Salzburg. Generally, it is a very green city and an excellent place for a work-life balance. On weekends, I spent a lot of time hiking, cycling, and traveling around the city. The city is quite touristy, which can be bothersome when trying to find a place to eat. I lived in Grodig, a small village outside of Salzburg, about a 30-minute bus ride from the office. Grodig is located next to the around 2000 meters high mountain called Untersberg, which I often hiked on the weekends. I lived in a small studio for approximately 550 euros per month in a Facebook group. The city has an excellent public transportation system.
