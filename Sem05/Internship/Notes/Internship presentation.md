* Has acquired number of companies in XR space in the last 2 years
* The technologies created by Wikitude and other acquisition have been reused for a new Qualcomm's project called Snapdragon Spaces
* Was where I had an internship

# Snapdragon Spaces
- Snapdragon Spaces is an open XR platform for developing AR software using Qualcomm's mobile hardware technologies.
- Launched in November 2022, it is currently in early access and will be generally available in Spring 2022.
- Provides basic AR features to allow organizations to produce apps quickly without developing the technology themselves.
- Partners include Epic Games, Lenovo, and Oppo.
- Offers resources to bring developers' ideas to life via head-worn AR with a cross-device framework and an ecosystem of tools.
- Allows creation of 3D programs for AR glasses connected to and powered by smartphones.
- Key features include locational tracking, image recognition, object detection, local anchors and persistence, plane detection, occlusion, hand tracking, and scene understanding

# My Internship

## Team
* Cloud team
* Worked with AWS Cloud Provider
* I have been working in a smaller team
* Austrian team, but we have always communicated in English
* We also did after-work activities like taking a Guiness pint, Tasting Whiskey, went for laser tag, went ice-skating 
* Had a flexible hybrid model
* Had a pair coding
* Code reviews

## Methodology
* SCRUM that was managed and kept track with Jira
* In mornings we had standup meetings
* We had biweekly sprints that always ended with sprint review. The team and product owners attended this meeting and each of us has presented their work that has been made in the last spring/last two weeks

# My experience

## Reponsibilities
* Developing features on the Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform  
* Creating a library of reusable CDK components to speed up IaC development 
* Designing and implementing Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS  
* Migrating wikitude.com services to modern and scalable infrastructure  
* Patching and upgrading Ubuntu instances  
* Scripting in Python and Bash 
* Creating CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins for infrastructure deployments

## My Improvement
* Improved my cloud and DevOps skills - AWS, Terraform, AWS CDK, Linux, Jenkins CI/CD, Kubernetes
* Improved my coding skills in TypeScript with node.js
* Improved my skills in presentations - I had presentations about different technologies like Kubernetes, CI/CD, project generators
* Improved my skills in SCRUM - worked with Jira, estimating tasks complexity and time
* I have taken and passed a Terraform Associate exam during my internship. The decision to take and prepare for the exam was also supported by my manager. People in the company always appreciated growth of the employees and take over new challenges and responsibilities

## Start-up and Corporate
* Because Wikitude was previously a start-up, I had a chance to look into two worlds - one startup world and the second corporate world 
* The start-up world was very fast-paced, flexible. The systems that has been implemented at the start of Wikitude has not been always been implemented for long-term maintainability, therefore it was sometimes hard to change/migrate legacy code and systems.
* The corporete world had many processes, sometimes it was hard to get things done due to many external dependencies - to other teams in the corporate for example. The corporate world always thinked about the long-term vision and every decisions was thinked-through from several sides

## Other
* Connected with so many professionals around the globe - most of them from Austria and US
* Found many friends
* Lived in a different country - Austria - had to sort out many things myself like accomodation
* Gained confidence in my work and realized the impact that my work can have

# Salzburg
* How I have spent my weekends - a lot of travelling, hiking, cycling and my last weekend I have ski toured
* Videos from travels
* Was a very nice place to live and have work-life balance
* Very green city
* A lot of turists - this was sometimes annoying when we wanted to take a lunch and we always had to go through the city centre
* City is super nice and has many places to explore - most famous is Fortress Hohensalzburg that can be seen from any part of Salzburg
* I have lived 30 minutes by bus from the office - I have lived in Grodig which is a small village outside of Salzburg
* Grodig is located next to Untersberg, that 1Â 973 meters high mountain. I used to hike there when I had nothing to do during the weekend. Also, I have ski-toured the mountain once all the way to the top
* Salzburg has a very nice system of public transport - I bought a ticket called Salzburg Klimaticket for approximately 300 euros, and I could travel by public transport anywhere in the Salzburg region - buses and trains.
* I have found a small studio and paid approximately 550 euros per month
* I found the studio in the Facebook group

# How did I get the internship
I have found the position on LinkedIn and I have applied through it there. Then I got an interview with the manager, and we discussed my studies, my projects and what I want to do in the future.

# My advice

## Think big
There are many opportunities on LinkedIn and other hiring platforms. Take your shot and do your best to get the position. One benefit that students from Via University College has is that they can present projects that they have worked on during the semesters - these projects are not small and there many technologies included that are also used in the industry. Leverage this and use it in the conversation with the interviewer.

## Improve your CV and profiles
Improve your profiles on LinkedIn and CV. Ask people to check your CV/LinkedIn in order to get feedback and make improvements. You have to learn how to sell yourself - at the end of the day, you are like a product that needs very good branding to catch the HR's attention and get an interview.

## Blog post
I have created a blog post with more suggestions on what helped me to get the interview and the internship. Feel free to check the link in the description of this video

# Conclusion
* Great experience for my professional and personal life
* Realized more about what I want to do, what I like and what technologies I want to continue exploring
* Had a chance to connect with many interesting people

# Addition
Connect with me on social media and feel free to ask any questions - LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook
