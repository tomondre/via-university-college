				QnA:
					Was is hard to get courses approved by Via? - VIA is not really helpful at all, and Wintec either. You will have to do select the courses but it is not really hard. You just need to select some courses in the Uni at New Zealand, they need to approve them and then you have to send them to VIA. Then VIA tells you how many credits you will get.

	Study Counselling:
		Hi,
		I have a few questions regarding Erasmus and the one-course proposal. The questions:

		I would like to have New Zealand as my first choice. I have found that there are two institutions that Via has agreements with:
		                - Otago Polytechnic - https://www.op.ac.nz/
		                - Wintec (previously Waikato)https://www.wintec.ac.nz/
		I am not sure which one to pick. Do you have some advice on based on what should I pick the institution?
		Is the tuition for the exchange semester free in both institutions?
		Where can I find exchange courses in these institutions? I have found a prospects but I am not sure which programmes I am eligible to.
		In a previous email conversation we had few months ago, you have mentioned: "Regarding choosing a destination outside EU, it is advisable to find private funding through scholarships etc.". I have found following scholarship that are offered outside of EU: LB Foreningens Rejselegat (LB Associationâ€™s Travel Grant). I won't be able to apply for it due to the reason that I have different insurance company. Are there any other scholarships that are worth to look into? (Except SU, I am not eligible to receive it without working in Denmark.)
		My second choice will probably be Malta uni. I have found the following courses that interest me: 
		               IT-BPR1 - Bachelor Project Preparation  - 5 ects
		               CIS3111 - Cloud Computing  - 5 ects - https://www.um.edu.mt/courses/studyunit/CIS3111 - Artefact (60%), Examination (2 Hours) (40%)
		               CIS2209 - Research Methods  - 5 ects - https://www.um.edu.mt/courses/studyunit/CIS2209 - Assignment (80%), Presentation (10 Minutes) (20%)
		               CPS1005 - Discrete Mathematics for Computing Science  - 5 ects - https://www.um.edu.mt/courses/studyunit/CPS1005 - Open Book Examination (2 Hours) (100%)
		               CCE3411 - Computer Networks  - 5 ects - https://www.um.edu.mt/courses/studyunit/CCE3411 - Examination (2 Hours) (80%), Practical (20%)
		               CIS2055 - Web Applications Architecture and Systems Development   - 5 ects - https://www.um.edu.mt/courses/studyunit/CIS2055 - Project (100%)
		Total ects:  - 30 ects

		What do you think about the courses? Would it be possible to pick these for the agreement?

		Sorry for the longer questions, but these are questions that are quite important for me.

		Have a nice day,
		Tomas Ondrejka

		Hi Reme,
		We have talked about your exchange in New Zealand. It looked like you had a super nice experience and I definetly want to experience it :D. I am currently making a bit of research and then I will apply. I wanted to ask you a few questions regarding it:
			What uni did you choose?
			How was the uni? Did you learn something or was it more about the travelling experience?
			Was is hard to get courses approved by Via?
			What were your monthly expenses?
		I have wrote to Via councelling but they didn't really answers to my questions therefore I think it would be easier to ask you (exhange student). :D 

		Thank you

    	Hi,

		My name is Tomas Ondrejka and currently, I am taking a Bachelor of Software Engineering at Via University College (4th semester). Starting from January 2023 I have an opportunity from my uni to go abroad as an exchange student and I like the idea of taking my semester in New Zealand. After my research, I have found your uni and I would like to ask you a few questions that I could not find answers to.
		  What courses am I able to take as an exchange student at your institution?
		  Is the IELTS test mandatory if my current bachelor's is taught in English?
		  When is the possible starting day for the semester?
		  
		Thank you,
		Tomas Ondrejka
