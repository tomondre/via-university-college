# Assignment05
NOTE: I am having issues with running the multithreaded program on my computer (Apple M1). The headers used in the C code are OS specific â€“ for Windows (<windows.h>), therefore I had to download VmWare with windows VM. I was able to run the sequential part of the assignment, but when I try to run the multi-threaded one, I am getting errors saying that the linker could not locate the pthread headers (even when I can see them in dependencies of the VS 2022 project and the IDE does not complain about missing headers). To me it seems like an issue with the pthread libraries that are being imported into the project. I have followed the guide on how to import these things, but still getting the same issue.
One of the warnings I am getting is that the library is of type x64 and my pc is arm64, so I believe this is the problem.
