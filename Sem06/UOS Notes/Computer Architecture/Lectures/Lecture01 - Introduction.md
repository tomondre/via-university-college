## Classes of Computers
* Desktop Computers
	* Single User
	* Low Cst
* Servers
	* Multi-users
	* Much greater capacity in both computing and storage
* Embedded Computers
	* Largest class of computers
	* Limited set of computation for fixed functionality
	* Usage -TV, Cell Phones

## Learnings
* How are programs translated into the language of HW?
* How does HW execute the program?
* What determines the performance of the program
* Which techniques can be used to improve the performance?
* What are the reasons of the multicore microprocessors?

## Speedup
* Optimizations of matric in the next five chapters of the book
* 1 - Python - Chapter 1
* 175 - Translate to C - Chapter 2
* 1365 - Data Level Parallelism - Chapter 3
* 2457 - Instruction Level Parallelism - Chapter 4
* 3686 - Memory Hierarchy Optimization - Chapter 5
* 44226 - Thread Level parallelism - Chapter 6

### System Software
* OS
	* HW Management
	* Applicaiton Management
* Compiler
	* Translation of program written in higher level programming language
* Bits
	* Binary Digits
* Instructions
	* Commands that are written in bits 
	* Each CPU has its own set of instructions
* Assembly Language
	* A symbolic version of instructions
	* Still too low level for most of the applications
* Langage Program Levels
	* C - High-Level Language Program
		* Increases Productivity
		* Less error-prone
		* Increases Portability across different computer architectures
	* Assembly Language Program
	* Machine Learning Instructions

## Memory
* DRAM
	* Dynamic Random Access Memory
	* Large memory
	* Made of capacitor
* SRAM
	* Static Random Access Memory
	* Faster, less dense
