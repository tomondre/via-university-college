# Linear Algebra
* Matrices 
	* Collection of numbers in square form
| a | b | c | - 3x3 matrics
| d | e | f | 
| g | h | i |
* Square matrics - same amount of rows and columns
* Rectangular matrics - number of rows and columns are not the same

# Basic Algebraic Operations
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* If a particular set of numbers satisfy all four basic arithmetic operations - the set is ==closed for four basic arithmetic operations==

# Natural Numbers
$${ 1, 2, 3, 4 }$$
* Known to us for over 1000000 years
* 1, 2, 3 âˆˆ natural number

# Integer
 $$ -1, -2, 0, 1, 2 $$
* Z

# Rational Numbers
* Q
$$ m/n $$
* Closed for 4 basic arithmetic operations
* Known to us for 3000 years
* Historically used for taxation

# Irrational Numbers
* Pythagoras 2 B.C.
* Rational number + irrational number => Real number R


$$A = (a_{1}, a_{2})$$
$$A = (a_{ij})$$
i = i-th row
j = j-th column

# Multiplication 
$$A _{mcn}  B_{ncp}$$
n The number of columns for first matrix
n The number of columns for second matri
$$ A = (a_{ij}) b = (b_{ij}) $$

Can BA be defined?

A = (1 2 / 3 4) 
B = (5 6 / 7 8)
AB & BA = (10 22 / 43 50)

BA = (5 6 / 1 8) (1 2 / 3 4) = (23 34 / 31 46)
AB != BA - non-commutative / non-abelian
