# Machine Learning Usages
* Identify the risk factors for prostate center
* Classify a recorded phoneme based on a log-periodogram
* Predict whether someone will have a heart attack on the basis of demographic, diet and clinical measurements
* Customize an email spam detection system
* Identify the number in a handwritten zip code
* Classify a tissue sample into one of several cancer classes based ona agene expression profile
* Classify the pixels in a LANDSAT image by usage

# Supervised learning Problem
* Has an outcome measurement - also called dependent variable, response, target
* Vector p predicted measurements X - also called inputs, regressors, covariates, independent variables
* Problem
	* Regression
		* Y is quantitative
		* Example: Price, blood, pressure
	* Classification
		* Y takes value in a finite unordered set
		* Survived/died, digit 0-9
* Training data - observations / examples / instances of the measurements

# Goals
* Understand Predict Unseen Test Cases
* Understand which inputs affect the outcome and how
* Assess the quality of our predictions and inferences

# It is important to
* Understand the ideas behind the various techniques, in order to know how and when to use them
* Simpler methods first to grasp more sophisticated ones
* Accurately assess the performance of a methos, to know how well or how badly it is working

# Unsupervised learning
* No outcome variable, just a set of predictors
* Difficult to know how well we are doing
* Different from supervised learning, but can be useful as a pre-processing step for supervised learning
* Objective is fuzzier
	* Find groups that behave similarly
	* Find linear combinations of features

# Netflix Problem
* Competition started in October 2006
* Training data is 18000 movies by 400 000 Netflix customers, each rating between 1 and 5
* Training data is sparse - 98% missing - this is due to users not watching all 400 000 movies - they have saw only 2 percent


# Statistical Learning vs Machine Learning
* Machine Learning arose as a subfield or Artificial Intelligence
* Statistical Learning Aros as a subfield of Statistics
