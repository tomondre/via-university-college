# Linear Model Selection and Regularization
* The linear model has distinct advantages in terms of interpretability and often shows good predictive performance
* There are other ways in which the simple linear regression can be improved, replacing ordinary least squares fitting with alternative fitting procedures
# Why consider alternatives to least squares
* Prediction Accuracy - especially when p > n, to control the variance
* Model Interpretability - by removing irrelevant features
