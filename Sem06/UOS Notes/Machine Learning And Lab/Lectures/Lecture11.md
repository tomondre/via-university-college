# Unsupervised learning
* Not interested in prediction because we do not have response variable Y
* Goals
	* Visualise the data
	* Discover subgroups
* Challenges
	* No simple goal for the analysis
* Benefits
	* Easier to object unlabelled data
	* Can automatically assess the overall sentiment of movie review
* Methods
	* PCA
	* Clustering

## Principal Component Analysis

...

* The second component analysis is linear combination of Xs, that has maximal variance among all linear combinations - uncorrelated with $Z_1$
* To make $Z_2$ uncorrelated with $Z_1$, is equivalent making $φ2$ perpendicular to $φ1$

...

## PCA vs Clustering
* PCA Looks for low-dimensional representation of the observations that explains a good fraction of the variance
* Clustering looks for homogenous subgroups among the observations

## Clustering
* K-means clustering
* Hierarchical clustering
